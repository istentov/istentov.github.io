## what?
this is my (istentov's) portfolio. i do not have a field and i work alone.
## who?
i am Trương Nguyễn Huân, living in Vietnam HCM city (but that can change soon)

to access my portfolio, type the link of this repository on the url bar, or click on this link:
[istentov's github site](https://istentov.github.io)

this is kind of like an about me and blog to commit my projects. it contains an about me section and a "hall of the featured" below to my finished projects (usually not small and takes ages to make)
